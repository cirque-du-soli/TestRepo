# TestRepo
Experimental Repo to try stuff :)

This is added during the first edit. what happens if i just commit to the main branch?

And what about a different branch?

A Branch 1 commit here
****What a wonderful file. No need to add anything else at all!!
Another Branch 1 commit

Looks like i might have to add this lil commit here to make Branch 1 good enough for the boss to approve the pull request.

Choppy chop



oops one more thing to main


Outside main thing hmm
